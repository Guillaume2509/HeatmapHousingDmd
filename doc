Desired output:

Heatmap of Quebec by municipality:
    Red = extremely high demand (including counting for what’s under construction)
    Green = don’t build here at all
    

How to get there:
    To get a color hue spectrum, one would need a score spectrum too. As well as a geographical locator.
    
    To get a score spectrum, we need a score. To get a geographical locator, we need one offered by data on incomes ideally.
    
    To get a score, we need to elaborate one, we could start with expected build and actual builds.
